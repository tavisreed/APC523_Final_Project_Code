# APC523_Final_Project_Code

In order to run this code, you need the numpy, matplotlib, and pickel libraries.

Helper Functions contains the code for creating the TCA model object, as well as plotting functions and saveing and loading file functions.

Each of the Run_X files can be used to Run an TCA model at X HPI in HCMV infection.

The Test file is an example on how to load in saved concentration matrixes and use them to create metabolite curves plots and concentration matrix plots.

Note: The Run files that can be sued for Test.py were too big (>25 MB) to upload to the github, but can be found in the zip file I submitted to canvas.
They should be added to the same folder as the functions.
